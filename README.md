# AI_Assignement2_Value-Policy_iteration
Support code for COMP3702 Assignment 2 2022.

The support code in this project is provided by The University of Queensland. Author: Nicholas Collins. 

The functions I have written is in the solution.py file, in the class Solver. The functions I have implemented is:
def vi_initialise(self)
def vi_is_converged(self)
def vi_iteration(self)
def vi_get_state_value(self, state: State)
def vi_select_action(self, state: State)
def pi_initialise(self)
def pi_is_converged(self)
def pi_iteration(self)
def pi_select_action(self, state: State)


To implement these functions I got a lot of help from tutors and their tutorials.
